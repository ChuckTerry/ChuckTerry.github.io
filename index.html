    <h1>The Home of Chuck</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Nothing...  Glad you could stop by.  Please enjoy this bland homepage and enjoy your time on it.  There's probably more pages around here somewhere, maybe you should ask around.  Google Maps can find anything, that's probably a good starting point!</p>
    <h2><a href="/projects">Projects</a></h2><p> - For when you've run out of internet and are so bored you need to check out what a jolly fat guy does to stay awake.  Good luck with that...</p>
