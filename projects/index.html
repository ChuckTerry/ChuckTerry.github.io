    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>Sometimes I take on personal projects, other times I'm "volunteered" to.  This is where you can find those... at least the ones that are worth something.</p>
    <h2 style="display: inline-block"><a href="./invictus">Invictus</a></h2><p> - Are you an instructor?  Does your campus use Moodle? Do you send students to Quizlet or Chegg to help them study?  Do you find yourself hating life because of it?  If you answered yes to those questions, this is the tool for you! </p>
